Implementation of MachineLearning Algorithms

**Purpose and Objective**:
Objective : To implement the various Classification models like Pocket , LDA , QDA, Logistic Regression on Bank marketing dataset and to compare and analyze the results given by these models by using various model metrics like Precision , Recall, PR Curve, Recall, Accuracies.

**Scope**
Consist of introduction to four Classification models. The assignment consist of :
1. Introduction to data and data source
2. Read and analyze the raw data from csv file.
3. Data Visualization using various techniques.
4. Preliminary Observations on data.
5. Extracting observations from visualized data and choosing a right set of columns.
6. Data Preprocessing like normalization and one hot encoding is done for categorical attributes.
7. Building classification models Pocket, LDA, QDA, Logistics Regression.
8. Train and use model.
9. Plot the graph of Test data Vs Predicted Data.
10. Using various model metrics like Precision , Recall, PR Curve, Recall, Accuracies.
11. Analysis / comparison of algorithms.
